This is an implementation of CSP solver on the board game called "Akari" 
or "Light-Up!".

Model the game board accordingly to:
1. White squares as "0"
2. Black squares with 0 inside as "-"
3. Any other black squares with the number N inside as "N"
4. Black squares without numbers as "-1"
5. Have one space spacing between numbers.
6. Endline after a row ends.
